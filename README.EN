What is Sanaviron?

The Sanaviron Project is an 2D drawing engine fully written in Python for represent composite vector graphics. This is
essentially a GTK+ Cairo based canvas. The effort focuses mainly on the design of budgets, invoices, labels and many
other types of commercial documents. Sanaviron offers a simple but powerful high level API that you can implement in
their programs. This widget can be used for flexible display of graphics and/or creating documents interactively.
Sanaviron is a GTK+/Cairo dependent component, so it is portable to many plataforms. Sanaviron is 100% pure Python,
but because the libraries used, it is easy to translate into ANSI-C using GObject mechanism and much easier to translate
into C++.

A list of features can be highlighted as:
* Paper and margins.
* Grid.
* Snap over grid.
* Object movement.
* Multiple objects selection.
* Multiple objects movement.
* Object resizing through cardinal control points.
* Object distortions through limbus control points.
* Simple extension and creation of new objects.
* Good OOP abuse
* Geometric concepts with greater understanding level.
* Barcode support.
* Statical charts based on PyCha (vertical and horizontal bars and stacked bars, pie, lines and points).
* PDF and PNG export capability.
